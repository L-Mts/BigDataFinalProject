100722,Sep,2022,2022-09-30,s accurate and its the whole reason for the push away from fossil fuels the justification is global warming which was once supposed to be an ice age or the ozone hole or lowering ice caps look back 50 yrs of scare
100723,Sep,2022,2022-09-30,when you cant substantiate global warming with science biden can always warm the planet with nukes
100724,Sep,2022,2022-09-30,for example in the last forty years accumulated heat in the oceans is 94 of the total with the remaining 6 distributed to ice land and atmosphereyeah and when oceans heat up theres global warming
100725,Sep,2022,2022-09-30,t know what he had for breakfast its a natural disaster if his cronies didnt virtue signal about sending aid to florida hed be even worse off than he is already biden is a joke and will be thrown out of office and held accountable for his crimes against america
100726,Sep,2022,2022-09-30,you support trump who denies climate change due to global warming from human activity whycc
100727,Sep,2022,2022-09-30,i think you find it was gayness responsible for that

100733,Sep,2022,2022-09-30,but anthropogenic global warming is the carbon cycle being unbalanced to where excess greenhouse gasses stay in the atmosphere causing abnormal retention of heat why are you so triggered by undisputed facts
100734,Sep,2022,2022-09-30,
100735,Sep,2022,2022-09-30,you can send 75b to an ally to help them preserve their independence in a defensive war and spend money on relief of a natural disaster which could not be predicted more than a week in advance if that
100736,Sep,2022,2022-09-30,im not sure how i feel about areas destroyed by natural disaster being called a war zone i bet my friends with ptsd would probably have an opinion on that something about the term used in this way irks me
100737,Sep,2022,2022-09-30,they want it to happen so we dont have to attend school girl youd rather want a natural disaster to happen instead of going to school

100740,Sep,2022,2022-09-30,the apocalypse hurricane ian after the reconstruction begins will become al gores amp john kerrys poster child for global warming amp climate change amy klobuchar already has begun before ian made landfall again can not waste a crisis on the people who are suffering
100741,Sep,2022,2022-09-30,the hurricane is gone l natural disaster
100742,Sep,2022,2022-09-30,the primary visible impact of global warming is more extreme weather like colder winters like snow at the wrong time like big fing hurricanes like more flooding from storm surges so tell me again how it isnt a thing
100743,Sep,2022,2022-09-30,or was it global warming was real we wouldnt have to worry about heating ourselves

105416,Sep,2022,2022-09-29,let an old person tell you that climate change is bs ive been listening to this crap since 1970 and they have been wrong for 50 yearsfirst it was freezing then the ozone hole then global warmingscience has been corrupted by grant money that deliveries what govt want
105417,Sep,2022,2022-09-29,this is probably super controversial but i think that if during a natural disaster you completely abandon your petfur baby then you should not legally be allowed to care for one again
105418,Sep,2022,2022-09-29,seek therapy kim you obviously have mental health issues
105419,Sep,2022,2022-09-29,you lie about global warming due to your mass formation psychosis symptoms and whats most disturbing is that you acutely believe you are telling the truth without scientific basis how much did soros give you in the last 20 years
105420,Sep,2022,2022-09-29,everything else is pretty much sucked
105421,Sep,2022,2022-09-29,but i m suspending disbeliefthe waffle house index was just meant to be a way to figure out how severe a natural disaster is not a point of pride
105422,Sep,2022,2022-09-29,i thought it was global warming lol you liberals make up your insane minds will ya
105423,Sep,2022,2022-09-29,business owners homeowners and boaters every natural disaster where the federal govt pays for repairs is packed with cases of fraud
105424,Sep,2022,2022-09-29,self promotion is gross no matter who does it
105425,Sep,2022,2022-09-29,some say its not climate change its weather wake up climate change affects the weather global warming melts ice caps raising ocean levels and increasing the size of storm surges stop seeing climate change as a political issue and start treating it as the problem it is
105426,Sep,2022,2022-09-29,that is so upsetting to see people being ignorant and also degrading and cruel to those suffering a natural disaster these storms are devastating i hope the government actually sends the aid available to the right places instead of just the metro areas
105427,Sep,2022,2022-09-29,that is what we need to see just after a natural disaster dont let this man anywhere near recover efforts ever

105431,Sep,2022,2022-09-29,
105432,Sep,2022,2022-09-29,s my point is it solely due to co2 is the axis of the earth taking us slightly closer to the sun weve had global freeze and global warming for billions of years there is no way to pin it on co2 so knee capping our economy over it needs far more investigation
105433,Sep,2022,2022-09-29,as i read these post it never ceases to amaze me how immature a majority of these comments are political and covid comments on a natural disaster where people have lost everything and some possibly their lives its just mean and heartless
105434,Sep,2022,2022-09-29,this isnt helping the effects of one hurricane cant be pinned to global warming nor can it be attributed to one man unless hes orangeamericans on average consume more gasoline and more energy than anyone else on the planetits an everyone problem
105435,Sep,2022,2022-09-29,s weird how elitist global warming activists like obama are buying multimillion dollar homes on the ocean actions just not aligning with mouththe only thing that will come out of all this fear and lies are higher taxes period
105436,Sep,2022,2022-09-29,t meant to be for me to be put on moral high ground i am just pointing out the hypocrisy of the right everytime theres a natural disaster its blamed on gays abortion etc you cant have your cake and eat it too
105437,Sep,2022,2022-09-29,recycling is a key way in which we can immediately do our part to help our planet and help stop global warming this is a step that everyone can do that might be small but if people begin to start doing it can have a big impact greenmovement spch145tweets6aw

109662,Sep,2022,2022-09-29,have the dems blamed the hurricane on global warming yet theyve already claimed theyve passed legislation that helps
109663,Sep,2022,2022-09-29,to be clear this isnt nothing any addition of greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere can have an impact on global warmingthe point here was to demonstrate that the calculated impact doesnt in my opinion justify the hyperbole being used by some in the press 3333
109664,Sep,2022,2022-09-29,based on that estimate the ch4 that might leak from the three affected nord stream pipelines is in terms of its global warming potential comparable to roughly 0027 of global annual co2 emissions thats the amount of co2 produced globally in just under 25 hours 3133
109665,Sep,2022,2022-09-29,therefore the 357492 metric tons of ch4 that weve calculated for all three pipeline leaks is in terms of its global warming potential the equivalent of releasing 9974027 metric tons of co2 into the atmosphere how does this compare with global annual co2 emissions 2933
109666,Sep,2022,2022-09-29,s why you dont live somewhere where you are always playing russian roulette now my taxes will have to help pay for all of these peoples bad choices its not a natural disaster its just natural its a cost of living where you chose to plant yourself

109673,Sep,2022,2022-09-29,re saying that you dont believe in global warming or science and youre also insinuating that you know more than scientists and meteorologists weird flex joseph
109674,Sep,2022,2022-09-29,we have been tracking hurricanes in the states since 1938 but now every hurricane that comes our way during hurricane season democrats say its bc of the myth of global warming these days even when the wind blows the libs say its bc of the myth of global warming

109689,Sep,2022,2022-09-29,every time there is a natural disaster like this hurricane in florida right now i think about how up until i started working if we would have needed to evacuate for any reason we probably wouldnt have been able to 1st we have no family
109690,Sep,2022,2022-09-29,to estimate the climate impact of these leaks we must first estimate the amount of methane ch4 released into the atmosphere from the leaks then we can compare the global warming potential of that methane to the amount of global anthropogenic co2 released in one year 1133
109691,Sep,2022,2022-09-29,sadly terrible reasoning notably reasoning by a caucus unable to accept climate change or global warming

109696,Sep,2022,2022-09-29,no wasted money showed what biden has been doing saved taxpayers money everywhere maybe they do what our laws tell them to do stop spending the us taxpayers dollars and enforce current laws paying for a natural disaster doesnt even compare to the cost of immigration
