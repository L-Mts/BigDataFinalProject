119663,To be clear This isnt nothing Any addition of greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere can have an impact on global warmingThe point here was to demonstrate that the calculated impact doesnt in my opinion justify the hyperbole being used by some in the press 3333,2022-09-28 22:22:04+00:00,2022,9
119664,Based on that estimate the CH4 that might leak from the three affected Nord Stream pipelines is in terms of its global warming potential comparable to roughly 0027 of global annual CO2 emissions Thats the amount of CO2 produced globally in just under 25 hours 3133,2022-09-28 22:22:03+00:00,2022,9
119665,Therefore the 357492 metric tons of CH4 that weve calculated for all three pipeline leaks is in terms of its global warming potential the equivalent of releasing 9974027 metric tons of CO2 into the atmosphere How does this compare with global annual CO2 emissions 2933,2022-09-28 22:22:02+00:00,2022,9
