81276,Nov,2022,2022-11-30,global warming might slightly reduce deaths short term although in the long run climate change is expected to increase the mortality that coldrelated excess death is decreasing 051pp while heatrelated excess death is increasing 021pp
81277,Nov,2022,2022-11-30,the main point was that deaths are going to rise and could become catestrophic if nothing is done to limit global warming data about deaths due specifically to recent heatwaves is minor in that context

82871,Nov,2022,2022-11-29,for example saying global warming exists because some cities experience heating 1 degree celcius in 40 years and thus average increased is not logical the city has more industries amp heat generation devices year by year thus it makes sense more heat generated from cities
82872,Nov,2022,2022-11-29,t happen of the 70s which then went too a hole in the ozone in 80s then global warming in 90s but the earth didnt warm enough in the time they said so we have to look out for climate change in 2020s

82903,Nov,2022,2022-11-29,if you think that global warming should be measured by average temperature instead of every place on earth here is my explanationthe idea of global warming is more heat trapped on earth from sun than what is released that heat will continually dispersed equally and thus
82904,Nov,2022,2022-11-29,need to realize that several decades ago climate scientists told us that global warming would first bring extreme weather not just heat waves their only uncertainty is whether its happening faster now
82905,Nov,2022,2022-11-29,
82906,Nov,2022,2022-11-29,

82923,Nov,2022,2022-11-29,hence one of the strategies that we ought to employ is imposing stricter speed limits say 55 miles per hour this also means that the more we build roads that let people drive at higher speeds 60 to 70 miles per hour the more were increasing global warming

85109,Nov,2022,2022-11-28,t know much about that period but it doesnt really alter that much we know the physics of how co2 affects global warming and the climate models are pretty accurate even when you go back and look at 3040 year old models
