21385,Feb,2022,2022-02-28,global warming reaching 15c in the nearterm would cause unavoidable increases in multiple climate hazards and present multiple risks to ecosystems and humans very high confidence
21386,Feb,2022,2022-02-28,3 the rise in weather and climate extremes has led to some irreversible impacts as natural and human systems are pushed beyond their ability to adapt some regions that are presently densely populated will become unsafe or uninhabitable under global warming levels3n

21406,Feb,2022,2022-02-28,climate change will lead to numerous risks to natural amp human systems for key risks assessed impacts are many times higher than currently observed projected adverse impacts and related losses amp damages escalate with every increment of global warming
21407,Feb,2022,2022-02-28,nearterm actions that limit global warming to close to 15c would substantially reduce projected losses and damages related to climate change in human systems and ecosystems compared to higher warming levels but cannot eliminate them all
21408,Feb,2022,2022-02-28,global warming reaching 15c would cause unavoidable increases in multiple climate hazards and present multiple risks to ecosystems and humans the level of risk will depend on trends in vulnerability exposure level of socioeconomic development and adaptation

21426,Feb,2022,2022-02-28,the magnitude and rate of climate change and associated risks depend strongly on nearterm mitigation and adaptation actions and projected adverse impacts and related losses and damages escalate with every increment of global warming spmb4
21427,Feb,2022,2022-02-28,
21428,Feb,2022,2022-02-28,the fact is oil and natural gas are used to make a lot of products we use on a daily basis if they want to add electric cars to the grid wind and solar isnt going to work build nuke plants and natural gas plants
